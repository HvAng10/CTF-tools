Copyright (c) 2010 - 2014 Nir Sofer



Description
===========

Most modern routers allow you to backup the configuration of the router
into a file, and then restore the configuration from the file when it's
needed.

The backup file of the router usually contains important data like your
ISP user name/password, the login password of the router, and wireless
network keys.
If you lost one of these password/keys, but you still have a backup file
of your router configuration, RouterPassView might help you to recover
your lost password from your router file.

  2000 and up to Windows 8.

Supported Routers
=================

Due to large amount of router models available in the market, it's
impossible to support all of them.
For now, RouterPassView supports a limited number of router models, and
I'll gradually add support for more routers in future versions. Also, be
aware that even if your router is not in the list, you can still try to
open your router backup file with RouterPassView, because some routers
are sold with different brand name, but they still use the same
software/chipset of other routers.

If you have router model that is not listed here, and you managed to
recover your password with RouterPassView, please report about it to
nirsofer@yahoo.com and specify the exact model name.




Using RouterPassView
====================

RouterPassView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
RouterPassView.exe
After running RouterPassView, you can open your router configuration file
by using 'Open Router Config File' option (Ctrl+O) or by dragging the
config file from Explorer into the main window of RouterPassView.
If RouterPassView manage to detect and decrypt your router file, you
should get a list of passwords/wireless keys in the main window of
RouterPassView. If RouterPassView cannot detect your file, it'll remain
empty.



Text Mode (Ascii and Hex Dump)
==============================

If RouterPassView shows you a list of passwords, but you can't find the
password or other data that you need, you may try to locate your password
by switching to Ascii Text Mode (F3) or Hex Dump Text Mode (F4).
In these modes, RouterPassView decrypts the router file, but display it
"as is" without analyzing the data stored in it.



How to submit a config file
===========================

If you have a router config file that RouterPassView cannot decrypt and
analyze, you are welcomed to send the sample config file to
nirsofer@yahoo.com, and I'll try to figure out how to read it and add
support for this file in future version.

You can also increase the chance of my ability to add support for your
config file if you follow the submission instructions below. However, be
aware that it requires you to disconnect your network and internet
connection for a few minues.
1. Backup your current router configuration and keep it in a safe
   place on your local disk.
2. Update your router configuration with dummy user names, passwords,
   and wireless keys. You should use very simple passwords/keys, like
   1111111111, 2222222222, ABABABABAB, 12345678, and so on. Putting these
   easy passwords give me a much better chance to crack the config file
   and find out how the passwords are encrypted.
3. Save the modified dummy configuration into a file. This file should
   be sent to nirsofer@yahoo.com for examination.
4. Restore your real router configuration from the file that you saved
   in the first stage.
5. Send the backup file with the dummy passwords to
   nirsofer@yahoo.com, and specify the router model/firmware and the
   dummy passwords that you set in this config file.



Using the 'Grab Password From IE Window' option
===============================================

If you try to recover your ISP/ADSL/L2TP/PPTP/PPPOE/DDNS password, but
RouterPassView cannot decrypt the configuration file of your router, you
still have a chance to retrieve the password by using this feature,
assuming that you have the login password of your router.

In order to use this feature, follow the instructions below.
1. Login into your router Web interface with Internet Explorer, and go
   to the password page that you wish to recover. This password page may
   look like this one:

   As you can see in the above screenshot, the password field is filled
   with bullets, but if this password field really contains the password,
   RouterPassView will be able to extract it and display it on the main
   window.


2. Go to the File menu, and choose 'Grab Password From IE Window' or
   simply press Ctrl+G
3. If the router Web page store the password in the password field,
   RouterPassView will display the hidden password:

   Be aware that some routers deliberately store wrong password in this
   field, and in for these routers, RouterPassView won't be able to
   recover your real password.

Translating RouterPassView to other languages
=============================================

In order to translate RouterPassView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run RouterPassView with /savelangfile parameter:
   RouterPassView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named RouterPassView_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   RouterPassView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
   (TranslatorName and TranslatorURL values) If you add this information,
   it'll be used in the 'About' window.
4. After you finish the translation, Run RouterPassView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run RouterPassView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
